# Boosting-and-Coordinate-Descent

The code uses UCI SPECT heart data set and and builds a Decision tree using ID3 algorithm.

Adaboost.java: Implements the boosting algorithms with hypothesis space consisting of depth 2 decision trees for the heart data set
CordDesc.java: Implements the coordinate descent algorithm with hypothesis space consisting of depth 1 decision trees.
